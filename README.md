Android bluetooth based call management app

I used to turn the car off at the traffic signals if its a long. So my car's head unit gets restarted and bluetooth gets disconnected temporarily during restart.
During calls i will have to manually switch to phones loud speaker in order to hear. So i made this app which i will start before i start driving. This will automatically turn my phones speaker ON during call when my cars bluetooth gets disconnected. So i didnt have to do anything manually. It also shows the recent calls and contacts in an easy to read/dial format in the lock screen itself.
This used to be my companion app while driving.
